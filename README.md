I was making a rhythm game and thought that some people might've wanted to do the same! So, I made a customizable module to simplify the process, but allow developers to measure rhythm however they want.

**Feature summary:**
- Get accuracy data based on customizable tolerance levels
  - Lower `Rating` = More on-beat, but `0` means the player completely missed
- An event (`OnIdle`) fires if no input is given and a key passes

[Here's an example](https://github.com/Beastslash/Roblox-RhythmService/blob/main/examples/PrintAccuracy.lua) that prints accuracy when a player jumps to the beat:

![2021-03-28 13-48-24 (online-video-cutter.com)|video](upload://60vocq7bO4S2ImpfDT8gzZX7Ksw.mp4) 

The example song I used was called ["Chatter (sting)"](https://www.roblox.com/library/1841804196/Chatter-sting).
