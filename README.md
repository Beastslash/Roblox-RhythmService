I was making a rhythm game and thought that some people might've wanted to do the same! So, I made a customizable module to simplify the process, but allow developers to measure rhythm however they want.

**Feature summary:**
- Get accuracy data based on customizable tolerance levels
  - Lower `Rating` = More on-beat, but `nil` means the player completely missed
- An event (`OnIdle`) fires if no input is given and a key passed.
